the corresponding boxes on his Air 
Status Display. This is repeated 
until all NV attacks are resolved.
The US player then announces his 
attacks on NV air units, rolling two 
dice and consulting the proper line 
on the Air-to-Air CRT for results.
Note that the results “2” through 
“6” are deleted from the CRT. They 
are considered “no effect.”
F-111 and F-4 units on bombing or 
strafing missions attacked by NV 
fighters are considered to drop their 
ordnance and join the fight. After 
the fight they must head for the US 
holding area.
Air superiority missions may never 
bomb, and must return to Holding 
Area after a fight.
NV fighters must return to “home 
base” after attack.

BOMBING
All bombing takes place in the bomb-
ing phase. US fighters dropping 
ordnance to join in air-to-air combat is 
not considered as bombing.
At the beginning of the Bombing 
Phase, the US player states which 
units will bomb and their targets, 
flipping the echo counters to reveal 
their numbers. All F-4 and F-111 
missions are considered to be low-
level attacks and must go through the 
Low-Level Flak Attack segment before 
they can bomb. The result of the NV 
Flak Fire is applied immediately 
(before resolution of bomb-run) and 
hit markers placed in the proper 
display boxes.
The US player then resolves each 
echo counter’s bomb run on the 
BOMBING TABLE using the proper 
target and bombing strength columns, 
rolling two dice and adjusting the 
dice roll for Pilot Morale. Note that 
bombing of Hanoi-Haiphong or other 
towns may lead to NEGATIVE 
victory point totals.
