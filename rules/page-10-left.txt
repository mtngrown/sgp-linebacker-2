FLAK CRT

The dice roll column on the extreme
left of the Flak CRT represents six of
the twenty-one possible outcomes of
two simultaneously rolled six-sided
dice. (The other fifteen outcomes are
considered ‘‘no effect’’ and are
deleted for practical purposes.)

The numbers on the top line
represent the number of SAMs fired
in a salvo. The numbers at the inter-
sections between the lines and
columns are the numbers of aircraft
hit and downed by the salvo. If tar-
get is B-52 or ECM aircraft only the
four ‘‘boxed-in’’ results on the CRT
are valid.

The Low-Level Flak CRT is only
used against F-111 or F-4 echo
counters attacking targets. The NV
player rolls two dice and consults the
Low-Level Flak CRT for the result. If
an ECM aircraft is present in the
attacking echo counter. he uses the
“ECM” column, in other cases the
““Normal’’ column.

AIR-TO-AIR COMBAT

Friendly air units (NV fighters or US
Air Superiority Missions only) may
attack enemy air units in the same
map box, during the Air-to-Air
combat phase. This phase starts with
the NV. player announcing what
echos he is going to attack. The US
player then flips the attacked echo
counters to reveal their echo number
and what aircraft they contain. The
NV player then rolls two dice and
consults the Air-to-Air CRT for re-
sults. The US player places the re-
sulting number of HIT markers in the
corresponding box on his Air Status
Display. If the echo counter contains
B-52’s the US player rolls two dice
for each B-52 in the box before the
attack and consults the ‘’B-52 Defen-
sive Fire’’ column on the Air-to-Air
CRT, and the NV player places the
resulting number of HIT markers in
