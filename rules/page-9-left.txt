INTRODUCTION
LINEBACKER 2 is a strategic game 
of the bombing of North Viet Nam in 
late 1972.

SETTING UP THE GAME
First, see scenario instructions for 
information on the forces available 
to each player. The North Vietnamese 
(NV) player divides his fighter unit 
counters between his air bases on his 
air status display. Two units (four 
planes) may begin the game in the 
air, represented on the game map by 
its proper echo marker (see move- 
ment). He then proceeds to indicate 
the number of available Anti-Aircraft 
missiles on his SAM SUPPLY TABLE. 
The United States (US) player 
divides his available air units between 
the target boxes on his air status 
display and places the corresponding 
echo counters face-down in the US 
holding area on the game map.
