SAM FIRE
All SAM fire takes place during the 
two SAM FIRE PHASES. The NV 
player may fire SAMs at all, any or 
none of the US echo counters in a map 
box (except the US HOLDING AREA 
Box). He decides the number of SAMs 
fired in each salvo and resolves 
combat on the proper column of the 
FLAK CRT, subtracting the number 
of fired SAMs on the SAM SUPPLY 
TABLE.
An echo counter may only be fired 
at once in every SAM Fire Phase.
