table represent aircraft destroyed on
the ground, and only apply to air-
craft in Airfield Alert or Landing/Turn
around boxes on NV player air status
display of airfield attacked. “S”
means airfield destroyed and may not
be used for remainder of game.
No “target of opportunity” bomb-
ing is allowed; a unit must bomb the
target it is targeted for on the US air
status display.

MOVEMENT
Movement may only take place dur-
ing the movement phase. All units
have a uniform movement allowance
of “one”, enabling them to move
from one map box to another, crossing
the dividing lines or moving along the
lines connecting the map boxes and
the US HOLDING AREA BOX. No
diagonal movement is allowed.
NV air units begin the game in the
airfield alert boxes of the NV air
status display (exception: see setting
up the game). In his movement
phase, the NV player may move all,
any, or none of his aircraft counters
into the “take-off” box, placing the
appropriate echo counters on the
game map, in the map box contain-
ing the airfield of the unit. The echo
counter may then move in the coming
game turns according to the move-
ment rules. The fighter unit/stack of
units must move one step on the
display boxes for each game turn
(movement phase) in the air, and in
the Movement Phase it enters the
Landing/Turn-around box, must
return to its home airfield. If the air
unit cannot return, i.e., the echo
counter is in another map box than
the home airfield, the unit(s) is
removed from play and may not
return till the next day (night, really)
first GT. If the unit ends up in the
South China Sea map box with air-
craft counter in “landing” box, the
aircraft are permanently lost, ceding
victory points to US player.
