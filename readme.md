# SGD Linebacker 2

A rebuild of the Combat! magazine game.

## TODO

The main part of the work is complete. What's
left is the "remaining 90%."

- Add US Holding Box to map
- Add South China Ses label to map
- Adjust Date counter positioning on the NV counter sheet
- Finish processing rules, which is actually an
  extensive list of subtasks, too many to list here.
- Create layouts for PDF and printing. Again, will
  have many subtasks.
