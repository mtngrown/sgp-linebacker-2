# SGD Linebacker 2

A rebuild of the Combat! magazine game.

## TODO

The main part of the work is complete. What's
left is the "remaining 90%."

- Render the map in black and white.
- Render and optional map in color.
- Create a player's aid card with all the CRTs
  and a sequence of play.
- Move all status, morale and turn tracks to the map.
- Finish processing rules, which is actually an
  extensive list of subtasks, too many to list here.
- Create layouts for PDF and printing. Again, will
  have many subtasks.
