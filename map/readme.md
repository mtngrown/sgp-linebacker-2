# Map generation using SVG

Generating the map was not the first choice. In fact,
the whole map had been traced in Inkscape and committed
to the git repo. But for some reason, that file does
not render correctly at all, not even close. Hence,
just generate it from coordinates, it's not a complicated
map at all.
