# Build the game

For various reasons, the game files are spread around
several directories, which makes it challenging to create
a simple, unified build process. To addess this issue,
all artifacts are copied into this directory. It's not a
great or even a good way to structure a build system,
in fact it's probably bad, but it's also not worth
spending a lot of time creating something elegant for
this one-off project.
